# Foundations
This a place where I can put projects to start off my coding foundations. I have started to work on leetcode and realized that I can problem solve but I was missing a step. A good foundation of coding. I realized if my coding skills are lacking then I will have trouble solving even the most simpliest of problems. This will be a place where I get a really good grip on the foundations.

## Project List

### Calculator App
A rather simple app that ensures I can deal with operators and logical statements.

### Temp Conversion

### Guess the Name Game

### File Manipulation

### Student Grading Systems

## Notes
All of these projects idea came from chat gpt. While the ChatGpt did not code any of these projects, I rather asked what are ways that i can improve my coding skills and these are things that got generated.
